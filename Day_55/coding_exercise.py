# Advanced Decorators
# Create a logging_decorator() which is going to print the name of the function that was called,
# the arguments it was given and finally the returned output:
# You called a_function(1,2,3)
# It returned: 6
# The value 6 is the return value of the function.
# Don't change the body of a_function.
# IMPORTANT: You only need to use *args, you can ignore **kwargs in this exercise.
