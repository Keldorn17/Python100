# Debugging FizzBuzz
# - Spot the problems üêû.
# - Modify the code to fix the program.
# - No shortcuts
# - don't copy-paste to replace the code entirely with a previous working solution.
# The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
# - Your program should print each number from 1 to x where x is the input number.
# - However when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
# - When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".
# - And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz".
